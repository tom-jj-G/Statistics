Residual standard error: 8.774 on 44 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared:  0.7149,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.6825 
F-statistic: 22.07 on 5 and 44 DF,  p-value: 5.35e-11

=> Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
According to the results above and the dataset provided, vehicule lenght and ground clearance (as well as intercept) are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the mpg values (with an assumed significance level of 0.05%).

=> Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The p-value of our linear regression analysis is 5.35 x 10-11, which is way much smaller than an assumed significance level of 0.05% for instance.
Therefore, we can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject a null hypothesis (null hypothesis: The slope of the linear model is zero), which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero.

=> Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
According to the summary output, the r-squared value has a value of 0.7149 and a significant p-value (<<0.05).
Thus, our linear model is quite effective.
Yet, although the relationship between both variables is statistically significant, this linear model is not ideal as our intercept value is is statistically significant, it means there are other variables and factors that contribute to the variation in mpg value that have not been included in our model.
These variables are not within our dataset and may still need to be collected or observed.



2. Suspension Coil Summary

coil_summary:

  | Manufacturing_Lot | Mean_PSI | Median_PSI | Variance_PSI | Std_dev_PSI
--------------------------------------------------------------------------  
1 |Lot1 + Lot2 + Lot3 | 1499.531 | 1499.747   | 76.23459     | 8.731242


coil_summary_by_lot table:

  | Manufacturing_Lot | Mean_PSI | Median_PSI | Variance_PSI | Std_dev_PSI
--------------------------------------------------------------------------  
1 |Lot1               | 1500.018 | 1500.206   | 1.146024     | 1.070525
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
2 |Lot2               | 1499.571 | 1498.873   | 10.131511    | 3.183003
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
3 |Lot3               | 1499.004 | 1497.981   | 220.010563   | 14.83275

Based on the dataset provided and the summary recaps above, all lots have a mean PSI value of about 1,500 PSI.
We could notice than lot 2 and lot 3 have an increasing value of standard deviance, meaning that pounds per square inch values are more spread for coils in these lots.

=> The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per inch.
	Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification? Why or why not? 
In we consider all the lots (cf. coil_summary table), the MechaCar design specification is met as PSI variance is about 76 for lot 1, 2 and 3.
But, if we dive a little bit more in the dataset (cf. coil_summary_by_lot table), results show that lot 3 does not meet the specification as its PSI variance is 220. Other lots (1 and 2) meet the MechaCar design specification.



3. Suspension Coil T-Test

As we meed to determine if the suspension coil’s pound-per-inch results are statistically different from the mean population results of 1,500 pounds per inch, we are going to use a One-Sample t-Test.

> t.test(coil_table$PSI, mu=1500) # One-Sample t-Test to compare dataset versus population mean of 1,500 PSI

	One Sample t-test

data:  coil_table$PSI
t = -0.65784, df = 149, p-value = 0.5117
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 1500
95 percent confidence interval:
 1498.122 1500.940
sample estimates:
mean of x 
 1499.531 
 
Null hypothesis (H0): there is no statistical difference between the dataset mean and its presumed population mean
Alternative hypothesis (H1): there is a statistical difference between the dataset mean and its presumed population mean
Significance level chosen: the common 0.05 percent

=> As p-value (0.5117) is greater than our significance level (0.05), we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, and we would state that there is no statistical difference between the dataset mean and its presumed population mean. 



4.  Personnal Design Study

=> Metrics of interest to a consumer:
	- Cost: as any good, cost is a important factor in people decision when bying a car
	- Consumption: as gas price that might keep rising, mpg is a key data when picking a car
	- Seating capacity: as needs might vary, it could a factor too for family
	- Cargo capacity: might help if important storage is a plus (for travelling or recreation purposes)
	- Safety rating: a "must-perform" factor 
	- Number of colors available: a good indicator of customizations possible
	- Number of warranties and incentives included: how many various offers are made by manufacturers (2 year warrantly included , gas credits, etc.)
	
	
=> What question to ask, the null and alternative hypothesis and what statistical test that could be used to test this hypothesis?
What we should ask ourself is, for each metric, does our prototype has the same characteristic as other comparable vehicles?
Our null hypothesis (H0) would be: there is no statistical difference between the characteristice of our prototype mean and its presumed competitors
Our alternative hypothesis (H1) would be: there is a statistical difference between the characteristice of our prototype mean and its presumed competitors
Significance level chosen: the common 0.05 percent
Test to use: One Sample t-test for each metric as we are trying to answer wether ot not there is a statistical difference between the mean of the sample distribution (our prototype) and the mean of the population distribution (its competitors).


=> What data should be collected?

For our prototype and its competitors, we should complete the data chart below in order to perform our analysis.
If there are different versions for each model, maybe try to summarize the data so we would have a unique set of data (one row) for each model.

Chart of data below:

                |Cost($)| Consumption(mpg)| Seating capacity | Cargo capacity(cu. ft) | Safety rating (1 to 5)| Number of colors available | Number of warranties and incentives included
